# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
In this project an async web app is created which fetches weather data for the requested pin code from `OpenWeatherMap API` and stores the results in the server's memory

## Gettings Started
The app can be executed with the following command
    node server.js
The app is hosted on the port `3000` by default but can be changed my making a change to the port variable in `server.js`
Only US zip codes are supported for now.

## Extras
If you are interested in testing your code as you go, you can use `tests.js` as a template for writing and running some basic tests for your code.
